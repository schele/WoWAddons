# ForeverPanel (World of Warcraft AddOn)

A full-width bar across the top of the screen showing at-a-glance information.

Out of the box:

| Side | Module | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Left | `money` | Gold, silver and copper with the in-game coin icons |
| Left | `bags` | Free bag slots with a bag icon, click to open your bags |
| Left | `xp` | `xx.xx% XP` through the current level, click to count down to the next one instead; hidden at max level or with XP turned off |
| Right | `clock` | Local time, click to toggle 12/24 hour |

The bar reserves its own strip of screen: it insets `UIParent` from the top, so
top-anchored Blizzard frames move down with it instead of being covered.

Right-click anywhere on the bar for `Settings...` and `Reset module order`.

The settings panel carries every option, including a switch per module to hide
one without removing it, and three tweaks to Blizzard's own UI: hiding the
gryphons either side of the action bar, turning on the game's health and
mana numbers on the unit frames, and showing the sell price on quest rewards.

Modules are rearranged by dragging them along the bar. The bar reorders live
while you hold one, so it is its own drag preview, and the layout is saved
between sessions. Which third of the bar you drop in picks the side, so a
module can move from the right group to the centre or left. `/fp bar lock`
stops accidental drags and `/fp bar reset` puts everything back.

## Install

1. Copy this folder into your client's `Interface/AddOns` as `ForeverPanel`,
   so the result is `.../Interface/AddOns/ForeverPanel/ForeverPanel.toc`.
2. Restart the client and enable ForeverPanel from the AddOns list.

The repo's `package.ps1` does step 1 for you, from the root:

    .\package.ps1 ForeverPanel -Install

See the [repo README](../README.md) for packaging and test commands.

Built against Classic Era 1.15.x (`11509`) and the 1.60.x Classic beta
(`16001`). For retail, change `## Interface` in the .toc to the current retail
interface version.

## Adding a module

`Bar.lua` owns the frame, layout and event plumbing. A module just describes
itself, so adding one means a new file in `Modules/` and a line in the .toc —
no edits to `Bar.lua`.

```lua
local addonName, ns = ...

ns.Bar:RegisterModule({
    name     = "durability",
    side     = "LEFT",              -- LEFT | CENTER | RIGHT
    order    = 20,                  -- ascending within a side
    events   = { "UPDATE_INVENTORY_DURABILITY" },
    interval = nil,                 -- optional polling, in seconds

    OnCreate = function(module)
        module.text = module.frame:CreateFontString(nil, "OVERLAY", "GameFontNormal")
        module.text:SetPoint("LEFT")
    end,

    OnUpdate = function(module)
        module.text:SetText("100%")
        module:SetWidth(module.text:GetStringWidth())
    end,

    OnClick = function(module, button) end,   -- optional
})
```

The bar gives every module a container `Button` at `module.frame`, plus:

- `module:SetWidth(width)` - report your content width so the bar can lay out
- `module:SetShown(shown)` - hide yourself; the bar closes the gap
- `module:Refresh()` - re-run `OnUpdate`
- `module:MarkDirty()` - request a re-layout

To put your config on the settings panel, declare it next to the code that uses
it — `Modules/Settings.lua` renders whatever has been registered, so it needs no
edit:

```lua
ns.RegisterSetting({
    store = "durability",   -- ns.db.durability.showPercent
    key   = "showPercent",
    type  = "checkbox",     -- checkbox | slider (slider takes min/max/step)
    name  = "Show a percentage",
    onChange = function() ns.Bar:GetModule("durability"):Refresh() end,
})
```

Registering a setting with no matching `AddDefaults` entry is an error, since it
would render a control that silently does nothing.

Every module also gets a `Show <name>` checkbox on the panel automatically, so
you do not declare that one yourself.

Name your font string `module.text`. The bar uses it to colour your text (the
bar owns that, so a module cannot make itself unreadable against the bar's
background) and to re-measure you after the first frame, which is the only point
at which the client can measure text at all.

Layout rules: `LEFT` flows left-to-right from the left edge, `RIGHT` flows
right-to-left from the right edge, and `CENTER` is laid out as one group
centred on the bar. Hidden modules take their spacing with them.

`side` and `order` here are only the defaults. Once a module has been dragged,
the position saved in `ForeverPanelDB.bar.layout` wins, until `/fp bar reset`.

## Tests

The formatting, layout and registry logic is covered by unit tests that run
outside the game against a stubbed WoW API (`tests/wow_stub.lua`).

From the repo root:

```powershell
.\run-tests.ps1 ForeverPanel
```

Or by hand, from this folder:

```
lua tests/runner.lua tests/format_spec.lua tests/addon_spec.lua
```

Frame behaviour and the `UIParent` inset can only really be confirmed in the
game client; the tests cover the logic around them.
